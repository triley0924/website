<h3>About PlainsFishing</h3>
	<p>Started 3 years ago by a Nebraska teenager, PlainsFishing has come a long way. From being a small company just selling to local bait shops, PlainsFishing has made its way on the shelves of some big name stores including Scheels, Cabelas, and Walamrt. PlainsFishing also loves to create video content to give tips to anglers over social media. It's first 4 years have definetily been a rollar coaster, but the future looks bright for this fishing company!</p>

<h3>About the Owner (Tyler Riley)</h3>
	<p>PlainsFishing Owner, Tyler Riley, grew up in Omaha, NE, and loved to get out on the water whenever he could. Growing up, Tyler couldn't afford to always buy  bait while he fished, so he decided to invest his birthday and christmas money into making his own baits. These baits quickly took off, and people loved them. Since then, Tyler has been doing his absolute best to keep his baits affordable and high quality.  </p>
